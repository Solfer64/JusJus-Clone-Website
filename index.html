        <h1> ABOUT </h1>
        <p>
          <p>Jus Jus is the first ever low-alcohol, sparkling verjus, now available
            in two variations: Jus Jus Day (3.5% ABV), and the slightly drier,
            boozier Jus Jus Night ( 7% ABV)</p>
            <p>Made from organic grapes in the style
            of a Pét-Nat, Jus Jus is fermented with wild yeast and has no added
            preservatives or sulfites. Jus Jus is the first low-alcohol sparkling
            verjus.</p> 
            <p>The tang of a sun-ripened kumquat, the heady aroma of
            honeysuckle in bloom, and the bright snap of a Bosc pear, set afloat
            on dainty, champagne-like bubbles. Serve chilled on its own, or as a
            spritz. </p>
           <p> Jus Jus is a collaboration between Julia Sherman of Salad for
            President and natural winemaker Martha Stoumen. Jus Jus is currently
            sold out online. Please contact us directly if you are based in Los
            Angeles and would like to purchase.</p>

<h1>HOW IT’S MADE</h1>
<p>Verjus (pronounced vair-ZHOO) translates to “green juice.” <br>Early in the growing season, farmers prune the vines of excess <br>grapes and press the fallen fruit to produce a fresh, tart juice that<br>–unlike wine–is never fermented. Verjus has been used as a more <br>delicate substitute for lemon in French kitchens since the middle ages, <br>and more recently, it’s complex acidity has made it a treasured ingredient <br>in the world of high-end cocktails. </p>
<p>Jus Jus is a playful twist on traditional verjus. We take that green juice, <br>tame it with a splash of ripe Muscat blanc, and ferment it ever so <br>slightly, to create a unique, low-alcohol sparkling beverage perfectly suited <br>to your festive brunch or week night get together. </p>

          <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
          <p>Julia was cooking on a vineyard while on her 2017 book tour when she eased the cork from a bottle of verjus and a curious fizz materialized. A lightbulb went off in her head: the volatile juice, with all its natural yeasts and sugars, had accidentally fermented in the bottle, making it lightly alcoholic and refreshingly effervescent. She downed the entire bottle. </p>
        <p>Piqued by a subtle buzz, Julia was determined to recreate this happy accident. But winemaking is serious business! She would need the right partner. </p>
      <p>All signs pointed to Martha Stoumen. Stoumen’s improvisational approach to winemaking lends itself to the creation of a product that defies definition — once fermented, Jus Jus is no longer verjus, but with such a low ABV, it can’t be classified as wine. </p>  
      <p>Just weeks after their first cold call, Martha and Julia met at 5am in a parking lot in Sebastopol, California. They drove North to Ukiah where they picked 1,000 pounds of dry farmed, organic grapes by hand and pressed them the very next day. Six months later, they had the hangover-free bottle of bubbles worthy of any fête.</p>
